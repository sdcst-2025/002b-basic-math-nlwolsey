## SDSS Computing Studies Python Assignment
### Assignment #2b Working with Variables (Total Marks 7)

Objectives:
* to perform math operations with numerical value variables and then print the results

You will be using the mathematical operators listed:
+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ division
** exponents
% modulus (shows the remainder when two numbers are divided)

Perform the operations listed and then display the output using the print() command.  No other output is required other than the numerical result.

### 6 Tasks
### Note: For each of your assignments, you do not need to use output.  The values of the variables will be read directly from the program.

##### Task 1
Open the assignment called a1.py
There are two variables that have assigned values for x and y
Display the sum of the two numbers (use addition)
The answer should be calculated and stored in a variable called "answer"
(1 points) 

##### Task 2
Open the assignment called a2.py
There are two variables that have assigned values for x and y
Display the difference of the two numbers (use subtraction)
The answer should be calculated and stored in a variable called "answer"
(1 points) 

##### Task 3
Copy the contents of a2.py and create a new file called a3.py that has the same content.
There are two variables that have assigned values for x and y
Display only the product of the two numbers (use multiplication)
The answer should be calculated and stored in a variable called "answer"
(1 points) 

##### Task 4
Copy the contents of a2.py and create a new file called a4.py that has the same content.
There are two variables that have assigned values for x and y
Display only the quotient of the two numbers (use division)
The answer should be calculated and stored in a variable called "answer"
(1 points) 

##### Task 5
Copy the contents of a2.py and create a new file called a5.py that has the same content.
There are two variables that have assigned values for x and y
Display only the modulus of the two numbers (use %)
The answer should be calculated and stored in a variable called "answer"
(1 points) 

##### Task 6
Copy the contents of a2.py and create a new file called a6.py that has the same content.
There are two variables that have assigned values for x and y
Display only the answer of x to the power of y.
The answer should be calculated and stored in a variable called "answer"
(1 points) 

1 mark will be given for having the correct value stored into the variable "answer"
